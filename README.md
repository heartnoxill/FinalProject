# Breath (Senior Project)

  In the modern era, several types of pollution exist around the globe, one of which is air pollution. The mixture of solid particles and gas in the air slowly deteriorates the city populations' health. There have been countless attempts to substantially reduce this particulate matter in the air, but to no avail. Therefore, to effectively aid in solving this air pollution crisis, our group will implement programming, data science, and machine learning to analyze the data pertaining to the atmospheric content and conditions over time. Insights, warnings, and a data platform are expected at the end of this project.

  Air pollution is the reason for many respiratory diseases. Ischemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer are the most common non-communicable diseases linked to air pollution. Moreover, increased fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations have been linked to an increased risk of respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer in various populations. This is the main reason that inspired us to make this project. We wish to gather insights, predictions, and make visualizations from the collected data in hopes of achieving cleaner air for human health.

## Objective of the project

  To integrate the concepts of cloud computing, data science, air pollution, and sustainability into a project. Using a cloud platform will benefit the data by means such as security, flexibility, mobility, loss prevention, disaster recovery, etc. 

  It will also be a good example to demonstrate the cloud engineering procedures for the upcoming Thailand server of cloud services providers. Data science will help us understand the available data better. 
The short period warning from deep learning methods will aid with the decision of the next course of action to deal with air pollution problems.

## Scope of the work

- This project will gather the dataset from online sources, for example, Thai Pollution Control Department, Thailand Open Data, Longdo Traffic, World Bank's Climate Change Data, etc.

- This project will develop a system using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to store the raw data and perform the ETL method to transform the data and keep it in the data warehouse. Then we will use Google's API to link the Google Colab and the GCP together for further data science processes.

- This project will perform the aforementioned data science methodology to deeply study the correlation between our datasets.

- This project will develop a short period warning system that will predict the PM value in the next short period. This involves using deep learning techniques, we will compare the traditional ANN method with LSTM method to see which one performs better.
